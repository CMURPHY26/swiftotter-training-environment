# The Art of Ecommerce Debugging
### A course to embed super-problem-solving strategies into your workflow: turning you into a super developer.

Hey, I'm Joseph Maxwell and I've learned a lot through my decade as an ecommerce developer.
It's my goal through this course to supercharge your capabilities as you build and fix websites.

#### I hate to say it, but...
This project is not a good example of the code that I  write. If you're looking to hire me to work on your project,
please don't take this as "the example" of my work. There is some super-good code in here. And there is
some code that's old. And there is some code that I've built to replicate, well (how do I say this), the less-than-quality
code that I've seen in the wild.
